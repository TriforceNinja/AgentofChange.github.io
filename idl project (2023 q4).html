        <h1>Our Services</h1> 
            <h3>General</h3>
                <li>Oil Change: The old oil is drained, and fresh oil is added along with a new oil filter. This helps lubricate the engine and prolong its life.</li>

                <li>Belts and Hoses Inspection: Belts (such as the serpentine belt) and hoses (such as radiator hoses) are inspected for wear and potential leaks. Damaged components may be replaced.</li>
                <li>Lights and Wipers Check: All exterior and interior lights are inspected for proper operation, and wiper blades are checked for wear and replaced if needed.</li>
                <li>General Inspection: A comprehensive inspection of various components and systems, including the suspension, exhaust system, steering, and overall vehicle condition. Any issues or potential problems may be identified during this inspection.</li>
            <h3>Custom Work</h3>
                <li>Performance Upgrades: Custom services often involve enhancing the vehicle's performance, such as engine tuning, turbocharging or supercharging, upgrading exhaust systems, improving suspension components, or installing high-performance brakes.</li>
                <li>Custom Bodywork: This includes modifications to the vehicle's exterior appearance, such as body kit installations, custom paintwork, vinyl wraps, aftermarket spoilers, and aerodynamic enhancements.</li>
                <li>Interior Customization: Services to personalize the vehicle's interior, such as custom upholstery, seat modifications, upgraded audio systems, installation of multimedia screens, or interior lighting modifications.</li>
                <li>Wheel and Tire Customization: This involves selecting and fitting custom wheels and tires to enhance the vehicle's aesthetics and performance. It may include different sizes, finishes, and tire types to suit the owner's preferences and driving style.</li>
                <li>Audio and Entertainment Systems: Upgrading the factory-installed audio system with higher-quality speakers, amplifiers, subwoofers, and integrating advanced multimedia features like touchscreen displays, navigation systems, and smartphone connectivity.</li>
                <li>Lighting Modifications: Installation of aftermarket lighting solutions, such as LED or HID headlights, fog lights, underbody lighting, or interior ambient lighting</li>
                <li>Custom Exhaust Systems: Replacing the stock exhaust system with performance-oriented aftermarket options that improve sound, power, and efficiency.</li>
                <li>Suspension Modifications: Upgrading suspension components to improve handling, such as lowering or raising the vehicle's ride height, installing performance shocks and struts, or adding adjustable suspension systems.</li>
                <li>Engine Swaps: Replacing the original engine with a different one to achieve higher performance, improved fuel efficiency, or meet specific requirements.</li>
                <li>Specialized Modifications: Depending on the client's needs, custom services may include specialized modifications like off-road enhancements (lift kits, skid plates), towing packages, racing modifications, or any other unique requests.</li>
